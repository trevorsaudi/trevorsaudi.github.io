#### Exploiting a deserialize vunlerability in pyyaml

Hackpack has recently concluded and we placed 47th out of 447 teams. In this short writeup we look at Yaml-2-Json in the web category

In this challenge we exploit a code execution vulnerability in pyYaml- a yaml parser and emitter for python. The server is using [pyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/tree/5.3.1) and Flask.

We get a simple web page with an option to parse yaml to json. I thought of using python payloads to get some code execution but they failed at first.

The message at the bottom hinting that I was not on a premium account prompted me to investigate the cookies.

Interestingly enough we can modify the premium value to true so we get premium privileges on the service

Sweet, so letâ€™s go for RCE and read our flag from the server

I used the following payload at first but it fails since subprocess will only accept single commands like `whoami, id`
`user_input: !!python/object/apply:subprocess.check_output [&#39;cat /tmp/flag.txt&#39;]`

My teammate [Koimet](https://twitter.com/k0imet_) helped me refine my payload to the following which gives us the flag
`user_input: !!python/object/apply:subprocess.check_output  
       args: [ cat /tmp/flag.txt ]  
       kwds: { shell: true }`

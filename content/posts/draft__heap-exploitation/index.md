#### In this article, we will look at the inner workings of the heap memory, the implementation of ‘malloc’ and ‘free’ procedures and how to perform some of the common heap attacks. This article is a good introduction to anyone looking to understand how heap memory works. Put on your hacker hoodies, let’s take a deep dive!

#### HEAP MEMORY

What is the heap and why do we use it, you may ask?

In low level languages like C and C++, heap is used to allocate new regions in process memory during program execution. It is essentially a large pool of memory from which a running program can request memory chunks e.g when you declare global variables in a program, they get stored in the heap memory space.

The biggest difference with the stack memory is that heap uses dynamic memory allocation where memory space is assigned during execution time or run time while the stack memory allocates a fixed amount of memory during compile time.

We can use the heap memory when we require to allocate large blocks of memory e.g large arrays to store data for long. The stack will be used for small variables that are required by functions as long as the function is being executed.

Beginner-Intermediate CTF that took place on Oct 28. We came 15th :).

This is the writeup for Listen, an audio steganogrpahy

**Challenge description**

_Listen carefully, what do you hear? Look closely, what do you see? To Submit the flag, put it in UPPERCASE and in this format RaziCTF{}. like this: RaziCTF{FLAG}_

We are given a wav audio file. Most audio CTFs are similar so I proceeded to open the wav file with Audacity.

I like to open my audio files as spectograms for better visibility. When I played the audio I could make out 2 distinct beeps and immediately thought of morse code. In audacity, the 2 distinct beeps are separated as shown above

The short lines represent dots (.) and the longer ones represent dashes (-) in morse code. I proceeded to translate the first wave form into a series of dots and dashes as shown below

`- .... .  .-. . .- .-..   ..-. .-.. .- --.  .. ...   ... .---- -- .--. .-.. ...-- -- ----- .-. ... ... --`

Decoding as morse code we get the flag :)
